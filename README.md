# Rot 13 Web App #
Web app for POSTing to your form and retrieving the text that has been *encoded* with **ROT13**. 
It is basically a *string translator* based on **Rot13**.

## What is ROT13?: ##
1. ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding.
2. Applying ROT13 to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary. A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on up to M, which becomes Z, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: N becomes A, O becomes B, and so on to Z, which becomes M. Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected; numbers, symbols, whitespace, and all other characters are left unchanged. Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and 26 = 2 × 13, the ROT13 function is its own inverse.
